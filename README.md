# Canvas Hosted-Data Examples #

Collection of examples that use Canvas Hosted Data to answer questions. Specifically some example
queries that you can run inside your redshift instance in order to get useful data out of the queries.
If you have some queries that are proving very useful to solve problems in your institution, we'd love
for you to share it by opening a pull request! See `contributing.md` in the root of this repo.

## queries/ ##

The `queries/` folder is where you'll find all the juicy stuff. These are where queries that can be
copy/pasted into redshift are located. You'll want to connect with either SQLWorkbenchJ, PSQL, or some
other raw SQL tool. In order to run these queries.
